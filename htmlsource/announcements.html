                    <div><p>A WEBSITE?  THAT'S NEW.  WHY DO WE HAVE A WEBSITE NOW? </p>
                         <p>The group known as UCLoL has existed for almost 9 months now, and in that period of time we 
                            have seen explosive growth - undeniably one of the fastest growing clubs at the University 
                            of Cincinnati.  From starting out as a 25 person facebook group, we are now an organization 
                            fast approaching 300+ members.  
                            Over the summer during our UCLoL Summer Tournament, we had 80 people competing in 16 teams 
                            against each other.  During this time, it became apparent that we were quickly becoming too 
                            large for just simply existing as a facebook group.  With so many different links to streams, 
                            registration, rules, brackets, and our general announcements, walls of text at the top of the 
                            page became a regular occurrence, as having anything less would result in the important 
                            information being quickly buried and lost.  We knew that something had to be done.
                            That something is uclol.org.  This website is intended to supplement - not replace - the current 
                            facebook page or ingame chatroom.  This website is going to serve as our go-to resource for posting 
                            and hosting all relevant information regarding UCLoL. </br></br>
                            WHAT KIND OF FEATURES ARE ON THE WEBSITE?</br>
                            This website has a boat-load of features that we have currently installed on it, and we will always be 
                            looking at ways to constantly improve it. </br>
                            Currently these are the list of the features that you can expect to find on our website: </br></br>
                            Calendar - This calendar is going to contain all the important information for upcoming dates 
                            throughout the months.</br>  
                            Members List - We have upgraded our members list from a Facebook Document, to a Google Document.
                            That document is embedded on this website to display all information in real time.  In this way we 
                            can display more information about our summoners, in a more orderly fashion! </br>
                            Social Media - Are you a member of our Facebook Group, but didn't know that we use Twitter as well? 
                            Or that we had a TeamSpeak Server?  Well you can easily access all that information now in one convenient 
                            place! </br>
                            Streams -  As a group, we have two dedicated Stream Channels which we use to show and record our events!
                            We can also host the Stream Information of our members, who might wish to make themselves known to our 
                            community, so that you can view your friends and mentors directly from our website in an easy to use fashion! </br>
                            Social and Competitive Events - Ever wondered what Exactly UCLoL is doing?  Do you ever wonder where 
                            exactly was that registration form, or what the name or rules of a particular event were?  We have 
                            designed a fairly straightforward and simple system that helps you answer those very questions.  On our website,
                            you can not only view what we've done Before, but what we're doing Now.  Not only that, but you can also view 
                            the rules for our current events and register for them too at the same time.  No more having to go through multiple 
                            services and pages!  This is the feature that I am most proud of, and the role that uclol.org was primarily 
                            designed to fill. </br></br>
                            Well... That about wraps up this not-so-brief introduction and tour of the new website!  
                            As I said before though, we will Always be looking to make improvements wherever we can.  
                            How this site looks now (September) will probably not be the same as if you view it 6 months down the road.  
                            In the meantime, please familiarize yourself with it and feel free to leave feedback and commentary!!  Enjoy :)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sincerely,
                            Chris Postell & the rest of the Staff </p>
